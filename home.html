<h3>Infused Investment Club</h3> <br />
<h2>Your Best Invetment is in Your Self</h2>
 </div> 
 
<div class="body">
<p>INFUSED INVESTMENTS PTY (LTD) is a club registered as a Company established in 2016 in Gaborone, Botswana. The Club understands the strength, capacity and dedication needed when starting and what managing a business entails. The Club members have the required energy, networks, experience and perseverance contributing to the success of its investors and business partners. We are honest and committed and believe in high levels of integrity at all times, regardless of the challenges that come along.
By registering a company, INFUSED INVESTMENTS CLUB has identified the opportunity in assisting new companies (SMEs) by providing business development services, not limited to funding and incubation through a process of Venture Capitalism or even partnership. The Club has identified companies (SMEs) with limited operating history that are too small to raise capital in the public markets and have not reached the point where they are able to secure a bank loan or complete a debt offering. </p>
